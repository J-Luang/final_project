Review
------

This sequel is a significant improvement from the first movie. 
Not only has the animation become crisper, but the story 
is more thrilling than before. The hints of humor add extra 
charm to the overall atmosphere of the film. The producers did 
a splendid job aging the characters appropriately and 
delivering a story that connected with the last one. 
It makes us yearn for a third movie just as good as the second.
