Review
------
This sequel is a significant improvement from the first movie. 
Not only has the animation become more clear, but the story 
is as thrilling as before. The producers did a good job aging 
the characters appropriately and creating a story that connected 
with the last one. It makes us yearn for a third movie just as good
as the second.
