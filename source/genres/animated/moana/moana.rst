Review
------
*Moana* was joyful to watch. The animation of the waves was magical and the music 
was charming to sing along to. The setting of the movie was inviting with the blue 
skies and island greenery, surely making viewers want to step foot into. The 
personalities of the characters, from Moana to the chicken, made the movie enjoyable 
and funny. If one thing could be improved, the story could have been delved into more.
