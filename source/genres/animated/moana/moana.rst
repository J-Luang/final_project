since she was a child and warns of the dangers that lie beyond the shores. 
Then one day, the village begins to experience a threat to the island, 
so she must go on a voyage to save her people. On the way, she meets the

Review
------

*Moana* was joyful to watch. The animation of the waves was magical 
and the music was charming to sing along to. The setting of the movie 
was inviting with the blue skies and island greenery, surely making 
viewers want to step foot onto the sand. The personalities of the 
characters, from Moana to the hilarious chicken, made the movie 
enjoyable and funny. If one thing could be improved, the story 
could have been delved into more. The full backstory of Moana's 
ancestors would have been interesting to witness.
