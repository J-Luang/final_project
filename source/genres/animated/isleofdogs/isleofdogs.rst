Review
------

The best strength about *Isle of Dogs* is its phenomenal animation. 
The style of stop-motion is different from what we have seen before. 
The world that is portrayed is interesting in that it is a dystopian Japan 
and the story elements take on a unique role from standard movies. 
One criticism of the film is that the storyline was fairly predictive. 
It could have been improved by keeping parts more secret until later on.
Other than that, *Isle of Dogs* is a fresh concept for its time.
