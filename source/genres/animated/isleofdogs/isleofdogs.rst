Review
-----
The best strength about *Isle of Dogs* is its phenomenal animation. 
The style of stop-motion is different from what we have seen before. 
The world that is portrayed is interesting and the story elements take on 
a unique role from standard movies. One criticism of the film is that the 
storyline was fairly predictive. It could have been improved by keeping parts more
on the down low.
