Review for Annabelle: Creation
------------------------------
5/10 Cravens
As part of *The Conjuring* series this second installation in the Annabelle 
branch leaves a taste that just says why. As part of this series it adds little
to the it and the only things that become known and relevant is that Samuel is 
the maker of the doll. Other than that the movie relies on suspense and jump 
scares where not many things happen. It relies on a spirit terrorizing a child 
and having the doll show up as a scare. Like many horror movies it because 
obvious when a scare will come up. Even the suspenseful scenes with its
psychological horror leaves little to be scared about. This sadly was a movie 
that was OK and definitely not the best or to be remembered but it was also not
the worse.
