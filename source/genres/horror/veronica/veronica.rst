Review for Veronica
-------------------
6/10 Cravens
This movie was all psychological horror with a spirit terrorizing Veronica and 
her family. The execution of how the spirit slowly worked on deteriorating 
Veronica mental state was what the majority of the movie was about and it worked.
The movie itself was not as scary as some films, but it was suspenseful of what 
would happen as the spirit attacked her family and terrorized her. It leaves you
wondering, what is the spirit, what does the eclipse symbolize and a couple more.
The movie does not leave you disappointed at the characters in the film all seem
to be shook from the events that happened. Having the spirit be an unknown entity
throughout the film does add some mystery to it because it's an unknown spirit,
attached to a girl and eventually killing her. All of that stemmed from a Ouija 
game where she wanted to speak with her father. This movie does leaves questions,
but is done in a good way, because it leaves the viewer wondering what happened,
just like the real life case in which this movie is based on.
