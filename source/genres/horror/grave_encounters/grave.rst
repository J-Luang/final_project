Review for Grave Encounters
---------------------------
3/10 Cravens
Grave Encounters relies on the psychological horror side in the found film genre
that has been popular in the past, but died out for a reason. Even the psychological
horror aspect of this movie cannot save it as the scenes go by quickly and at
always leads up to a jump scare. Having the characters run through the same 
halls, yelling at each other while they go mad offers little to the experience
of the movie. The only disturbing part of the movie is when you see the spirits
manifested in their forms that offer disturbing human like creatures with
something missing. The spirits also offer very little as the characters run away,
hide and never see the spirit again. This was a movie that like its genre of found
film, should be left behind.
