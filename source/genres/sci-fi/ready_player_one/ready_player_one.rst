Before his death, Halliday placed an "easter egg" somewhere in the vastly infinite world of the OASIS, containing both the key to his large inheritance and the key to the entire OASIS. With people of all ages playing from everywhere in the world, Wade Watts, a young teenager, dedicates his time to solving the mysteries of the OASIS.
