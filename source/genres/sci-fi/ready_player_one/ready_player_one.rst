Ready Player One sets in 2045 when the world we know, is on the verge of 
collapse. With the world in shreads, the only positive is the video game 
creation of James Halliday, OASIS. OASIS is a virtual reality universe 
containing everything a person can imagine but when the brilliant Halliday 
passes away, the game becomes so much more. Before his death, Halliday placed an 
"easter egg" somewhere in the vastly infinite world of the OASIS, containing 
both the key to his large inheritance and the key to the entire OASIS. With 
people of all ages playing from everywhere in the world, Wade Watts, a young 
teenager, dedicates his time to solving the mysteries of the OASIS. As Wade gets 
closer to unravelling the truths of the game, he is thrown into a chaos both in 
the OASIS and out of it.
