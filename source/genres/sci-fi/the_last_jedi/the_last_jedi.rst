Review
------

5/10

Star Wars: The Last Jedi packs in a large amount of possibilities for the Star 
Wars Universe, but lacks the same in the immense amounts of plotholes found 
throughout the entirety of the film. Director Rian Johnson takes a huge leap in 
the individual stories of those like Luke Skywalker and Supreme Leader Snoke 
and completely misses the mark with Star Wars fans. Along with these leaps in 
characters, Johnson also felt the need to implement new characters into the 
universe who seemed important but didn't receive any background or character 
development whatsoever. This movie is given a 5/10 simply because of the vast 
amount of opinions that can be developed by audiences.
