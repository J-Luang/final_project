Review
------

5/10

Star Wars: The Last Jedi packs in a large amount of possibilities for the Star Wars Universe, but lacks the same in the immense amounts of plotholes found throughout the entirety of the film. Director Rian Johnson takes a huge leap in the individual stories of those like Luke Skywalker and Supreme Leader Snoke and completely misses the mark with Star Wars fans. Along with these leaps in characters, Johnson also felt the need to implement new characters into the universe who seemed important but didn't receive any background or character development whatsoever. This movie is given a 5/10 simply because of the vast amount of opinions that can be developed by audiences.
