Review
------

6.5/10 Cravens 

Fantastic Beasts is a creative movie playing on the idea of the Harry Potter series. This movie brings a new magical twist to the Wizarding World we all know and love, but lacks the development of individual characters throughout the movie. Overall, this movie is just above average finding tough criticism from the success of the Harry Potter series.
