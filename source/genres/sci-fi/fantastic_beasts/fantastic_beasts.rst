Review
------

6.5/10 Cravens 

Fantastic Beasts is a creative movie playing on the idea of the Harry Potter 
series. This movie brings a new magical twist to the Wizarding World we all know 
and love, but lacks the development of individual characters throughout the 
movie. Overall, this movie is just above average finding tough criticism from 
the success of the Harry Potter series.
