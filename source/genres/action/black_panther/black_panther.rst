Black Panther
=========================

**10/10 Cravens**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Black Panther is one of Marvel's most fully realized films. Wonderfully fleshed out characters, beautiful cinematography, and a well thought out plot help expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Killmonger is one of Marvel's best villians to date, and the commentary on today's world is done in a powerful way.

Something in particular I enjoyed was the costuming within this movie. Ample research was done to create an incredibly realistic afrofuturistic society, which was incredibly impactful to the Marvel Universe.
