Black Panther
=========================

10/10 Cravens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Black Panther is one of Marvel's most fully realized films. Wonderfully fleshed out characters, beautiful cinematography, and a well thought out plot help expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Killmonger is one of Marvel's best villians to date, and the commentary on today's world is done in a powerful way. A lot is packed into this movie however they managed to pull it off without the film seeming rushed or overwhelming. The actor's performances were all top notch, and the CGI looked incredibly realistic. 

Something in particular I enjoyed was the costuming within this movie. Ample research was done to create an incredibly realistic afrofuturistic society, which was impactful to the Marvel Universe. This movie is important to all of the youth of color who now have heros that look like them to look up to.
