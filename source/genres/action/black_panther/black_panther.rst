Black Panther
=========================

10/10 Cravens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Black Panther is one of Marvel's most fully realized films. Wonderfully fleshed 
out characters, beautiful cinematography, and a well thought out plot help expand
 the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Killmonger is one of Marvel's best villians to 
 date, and the commentary on today's world is done in a powerful way. A lot is 
 packed into this movie however they managed to pull it off without the film 
 seeming rushed or overwhelming. The actor's performances were all top notch, 
 and the CGI looked incredibly realistic. This movie leaves a big legacy to 
 follow up on, and many new potential storylines.

Something in particular I enjoyed was the costuming within this movie. Ample 
research was done to create an incredibly realistic afrofuturistic society, 
which was impactful to the Marvel Universe. Everything from the buildings, 
clothing, technology, and lifestyles were fully developed to create this realistic
 world. This movie also helps to increase the standards of diversity in Hollywood 
 movies. This movie is important to all of the youth of color who now have heros 
 that look like them to look up to.
