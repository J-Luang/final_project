Peppermint
=========================

**3/10 Cravens**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a very promising premise Peppermint was a bit of a let down. While the idea
of a gender flip on the stereotypical action revenge porn could create an 
intriguing character psychology, Peppermint fell short of this goal. While the 
idea was still creative, it needed a little more punch.

Following the murder of her family Jennifer Garner's character disapears for 
five years to train to be a killing machine. Garner's performance as an actor 
was wonderful however the plot on cinematography really let her down. The fight
scenes were lacking in creativity and many scenes were so dark you could barely
see the content. 

Biggest Issue
-------------

The line in which Garner's character tells her daughter she has "peppermint in
her blood" (Which is where the title for the movie comes from) WAS CUT FROM THE
MOVIE ENTIRELY. Seriously, While this line is heavily featured in the trailers 
it is never in the movie which really confused me as a viewer. Why would you 
name the movie after a line that doesn't exist in the final project?!?!
