Avengers
=========================

9/10 Cravens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

THe movie that brings all the heros together for one big battle! With awesome fight scenes and well thought out character development this movie packs quite a punch. The actors worked really well on screen together, and Robert Downey Jr played Tony Stark's signature sense of humor spot on.
