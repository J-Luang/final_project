Avengers
=========================

9/10 Cravens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The movie that brings all the heros together for one big battle! With awesome 
fight scenes and well thought out character development this movie packs quite 
a punch. The actors worked really well on screen together, and Robert Downey Jr.
 played Tony Stark's signature sense of humor spot on. The CGI is high quality 
 and does not detract from the movie experience. Tom Hiddleston plays the 
 villian Loki with incredible realism. The character development throughout the 
 movie is incredibly realistic. A truely ambitious project which was completed
 with huge sucess.
