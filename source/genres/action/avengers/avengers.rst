The movie that brings all the heros together for one big battle! With awesome 
fight scenes and well thought out character development this movie packs quite 
a punch. The action scenes were plentiful and well thought out. The actors worked
really well on screen together, and Robert Downey Jr. 
played Tony Stark's signature sense of humor spot on. This is truely a comic book masterpiece.
The CGI is high quality 
and does not detract from the movie experience. Tom Hiddleston plays the 
villian Loki with incredible realism. The character development throughout the 
movie is incredibly realistic. A truely ambitious project which was completed
with huge sucess. The Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to thrive and grow and
this film has added a lot of options for it to expand. 
One important point during this movie was the development of the Hulk. 
Past Hulk movies have struggled quite a bit, people didnt connect with the character,
and the films were never that popular. However Mark Ruffalo did an amazing job, 
he worked incredibly well as Banner and made the character much more relatablef.

While the movie is fast-paced it never feels rushed or too cramped. Whedon's 
screenwriting is excellent and truely exceeds expectations. 

 Directed by Joss Whedon.
