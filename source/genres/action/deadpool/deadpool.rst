Deadpool
=========================

10/10 Cravens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fight scenes, explosions, and chimichangas galore Deadpool is the comedy of the 
season. Deadpool was wonderously performed by Ryan Reynolds. This foul mouthed 
anti-hero is better than you could have imagined. For those unfamiliar with the 
character they may have been shocked by the style of humor. Ryan Reynolds was 
the perfect choice to play Deadpool, and he pulls the character off flawlessly. 
Fans of the comics and newbies alike will love this movie. 
The best film to come out of the Marvel Mutant genre, it manages to cleverly 
mock itself and the other movies within its universe. Reminder that this is 
definitely not a movie for children.
