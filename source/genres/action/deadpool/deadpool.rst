Deadpool
=========================

**10/10 Cravens**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The comedy of the season. Deadpool was wonderously performed by Ryan Reynolds. This foul mouthed anti-hero is better than you could have imagined for fans of this character. For those unfamiliar with the character they may have been shocked by the style of humor. 
The best film to come out of the Marvel Mutant genre, it manages to cleverly mock itself and the other movies within its universe. Reminder that this is Definitely not a movie for children.
