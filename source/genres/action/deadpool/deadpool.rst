Deadpool
=========================

10/10 Cravens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fight scenes, explosions, and chimichangas galore Deadpool is the comedy of the 
season. After the flop that was the Fantastic Four remake many wondered if Fox would
be able to pull off this film. Deadpool was wonderously performed by Ryan Reynolds. This foul mouthed 
anti-hero is better than you could have imagined. For those unfamiliar with the 
character they may have been shocked by the style of humor. Ryan Reynolds was 
the perfect choice to play Deadpool, and he pulls the character off flawlessly. 
Fans of the comics and newbies alike will love this movie. The signature humor of
Deadpool is brilliantly written to life. The villian Francis is well developed. 
The fourth-wall breaks also create a unique film style that I have not seen in other
recent films.  
This is the best film to come out of the Marvel Mutant genre, it manages to cleverly 
mock itself and the other movies within its universe. Years ago when a highly 
CGIed clip showing a scene from the Deadpool movie idea was leaked no one could 
have known just how amazing the movie would be. Reminder that this is definitely
not a movie for children.
